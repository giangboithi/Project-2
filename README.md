# project overview
For me community means support, helping, together and share the same problems and going through problems together like family. My sense of community affected by the pandemic was people needed to distance with each other, as me had difficult when connect with people in the community, as long as my friends and relatives. I needed to connect people through internet, through Zoom, so I understood more about it doesn't matter how far you are or can you meet people in person or not, you can still connect with them and me and my relatives more and more connect through internet through distance. I found my community in SF State by my family, friends and people around my area.  I do long for my community back home such as my cousins, relatives and my friends. It felt a little bit strange at first because I had to start everything again, made new friends, started to get use to the area that I live and started to understand the community around me. However, I have a big family here, so I see my family as a community and people support each other in my family. Community is very important to me, I need community for supporting for helping for developing together, and I think I am very proud that I can be a. part of community so that I can help people, support people and develop together as an individual and as a community.
